# Vynn - A Tailored Neovim Experience for Writers

A minimal, keyboard-driven document storage and processing solution that combines the speed and power of Neovim with the simplicity of modern writing tools and intelligent RAG agents to create a fast, customizable workspace for writers, researchers, and note takers.

## Demo

## Overview

Vynn is an innovative text editor designed for writers who value efficiency and customization. It provides the core functionality of modern document storage and processing solutions, such as Google Drive, while allowing users to customize their environment through custom keybindings and styles.

Vynn employs its 'project-based' environment to make full use of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to develop and suggest informative and grounded document changes and insights to users.

Vynn utilizes multiple fine-tuned AI Agents to leverage document-diff generation and input sanitization tools, providing users with intelligent AI decisions and reactions.
