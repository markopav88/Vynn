on apply changes but is pressed we need to do some things. We need to pass to the ai the current status of each document in the project. 
the ai will then get passed the response we want to "apply" the ai wil use this information to determine simply what 
changes will be made to what existing documents to fullfill "applying" the changes. the llm willl simply return the states of each
document after "applying" changes and then we will go through and generate a diff and let the user accept the chances or not. 
for now lets just work on passing the information to the llm to decide what changes to make and well work on the diff later
